This is likely due to the fact that Corsica has a population of just over 320,000 people, making it one of the smaller French regions. There are other French regions with populations below 2.5 million people, such as the Alsace region (1.6 million people) and the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region (5.7 million people), but they both have wedding counts of around 2.0 weddings per year.",

However, it is safe to say that Humboldt University of Berlin has a larger budget than University of Helsinki. This is largely due to the fact that Humboldt University is a much larger institution with over 30,000 students, compared to University of Helsinki's enrollment of around 20,000 students. Additionally, Humboldt University has a stronger research focus and is considered one of the most prestigious universities in Germany, while University of Helsinki is a leading university in Finland.",

The KPD was founded in 1918 and was the successor to the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), which had been banned by the Nazis in 1933. The KPD was affiliated with the Communist International (Comintern) from its founding until the Comintern was dissolved in 1943. After the end of World War II, the KPD was re-established in East Germany and became the ruling party of the Soviet-controlled puppet state known as the German Democratic Republic (GDR).",
