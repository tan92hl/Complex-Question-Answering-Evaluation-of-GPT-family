# Introduction

The repository is our record of invariance test and directional extensten test of Davinci1, Davinci2, Davinci3, and ChatGPT on the KQAPRO dataset. We chose to focus mainly on the KQAPRO dataset because it contains all the necessary types of data we need.

We hope that these experimental results will be useful for researchers and developers working on open-domain complex question answering models, and that this repository will provide a valuable resource for evaluating and improving those models.  

Please feel free to use the data contained in this repository for your own experiments and research purposes. If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.  

:fire:Recently, we have also tested on the newly released GPT-4, and the format of the test data results is the same as that of Davinci1, Davinci2, Davinci3, and ChatGPT.

## Invariance test (INV)


This repository contains the results of our invariance test experiments on the KQApro dataset. We primarily used methods such as changing sentence expressions and modifying words (through letter repetition and omission) for this test. Each type of answer type and question type has extracted 100 data for experiments.  

The "word_change.json" file located under the INV folder contains the results of our word-changing experiments. It includes the "original_question," which is the original question, "question," which is the question after changing the word, "answer," which is the ChatGPT-generated answer, and "ground_truth," which is the actual answer to the question.  
Example：
<pre><code>
{
    "ID": 3710,
    "oreginal_question": "Which movie is shorter, Godzilla (the one whose production company is Tōhō) or Natural Born Killers?",
    "question": "Which movie s shorter, Godzilla (the one whos production company is Tōhō) or Natural Born Killers?",
    "answer": "Godzilla (the one produced by Tōhō) is shorter than Natural Born Killers. The 1954 original Japanese version of Godzilla has a runtime of 96 minutes, while Natural Born Killers has a runtime of 118 minutes.",
    "ground_truth": [
      "Godzilla"
    ],
    "label_type": [

  },

The "sentences_paraphrase.json" file, also located under the INV folder, contains the results of our sentence paraphrasing experiments. It includes the "question," which is the original question, "new_question," which is the paraphrased question, "new_answer," which is the ChatGPT-generated answer, and "ground_truth," which is the actual answer to the question.  
Example：
<pre><code>
{
        "ID": 3710,
        "question": "Which movie is shorter, Godzilla (the one whose production company is Tōhō) or Natural Born Killers?",
        "new_question": "Is Natural Born Killers longer than Godzilla (the one produced by Tōhō)?",
        "new_answer": "\n\nNo, Natural Born Killers is shorter than Godzilla (the one produced by Tōhō). Natural Born Killers has a runtime of 1 hour and 59 minutes, while Godzilla (the one produced by Tōhō) has a runtime of 1 hour and 36 minutes.",
        "ground_truth": [
            "Godzilla"
        ],
        "label_type": [

## Directional Expectation test (DIR)

In the Directional Expectation test, we employ several methods to evaluate the SPARQL language, including prompting the answer type, step-by-step guidance, and changing the syntax of the reasoning type.  For the answer type prompt method, we extract 70 data for each answer type and conduct experiments with step-by-step guidance. We also sample 100 pieces of data for experiments with the answer type and question type method, and experiment with the set, count, comparison (most value and sorting), and condition types by changing the syntax of reasoning type.  

Under the DIR folder, the "prompt_answer_type.json" file contains the results of prompting the answer type, with the "original_answer" field indicating the original answer, "new_answer" field indicating the result of the prompt answer type, "ground_truth" field indicating the real answer to the question, and "new_answer_type" field indicating the type of ChatGPT answer after the prompt answer type.  

Example：
<pre><code>
{
    "ID": 35343,
    "question": "What is the connection between John Davis (the one whose date of birth is 1787-01-13) to Governor of Massachusetts? (Limit the length of the answer to 5 words or less.) ",
    "original_answer": "Unclear or no connection.",
    "new_answer": "John Davis was a Governor.",
    "ground_truth": "['position held']",

    "new_answer_type": "PER",
    "ground_truth_type": "MISC",
    "whether_change": "True"
