    "step 7 answer": "\"Godzilla (the one whose production company is Toho)\" is a phrase that specifies a particular version of the Godzilla movie.

By specifying \"the one whose production company is Toho,\" the speaker is indicating that they are referring to the original Japanese version of the movie, which is often considered the most iconic and influential version of the film.",

However, generally speaking, \"Natural Born Killers\" is a shorter movie than the original \"Godzilla\" movie produced by Toho. \"Natural Born Killers\" has a runtime of approximately 1 hour and 59 minutes, while the original \"Godzilla\" movie produced by Toho has a runtime of approximately 1 hour and 36 minutes.",
