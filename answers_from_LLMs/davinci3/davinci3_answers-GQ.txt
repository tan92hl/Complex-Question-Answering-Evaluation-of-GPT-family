1903	what caused the failure of the st. francis dam?	  The failure of the St. Francis Dam was caused by a combination of poor engineering, inadequate geological surveys, and a rush to complete the project. The dam was built on a poorly chosen site, on unstable foundations, and was not designed to handle the amount of water it was filled with. Additionally, the dam was not tested for leakage prior to filling, and the engineers did not take into account the effects of earthquakes on the structure.
1904	what caused the failure of the saint francis dam?	  The failure of the Saint Francis Dam was caused by a combination of design flaws and construction errors. The dam was built on a geologically unstable foundation, and its curved design created a weak spot in the structure. Additionally, the dam was built too quickly, with inadequate testing and inspection of the concrete. Finally, the dam was filled too rapidly, which caused seepage and undermined the foundation.
1905	what's the cause of failure of the st. francis dam?	  The cause of failure of the St. Francis Dam was attributed to a combination of design flaws and geological conditions. The dam was built on weak, unconsolidated sedimentary rock that was highly fractured, and the dam was designed with a curved upstream face which caused the dam to be unstable. Additionally, the dam was built too high, which caused it to be overtopped during a heavy rainstorm.
1906	what's the cause of failure of the saint francis dam?	  The failure of the Saint Francis Dam was caused by a combination of factors, including poor design and construction, inadequate geological testing, and the presence of a large fault in the bedrock beneath the dam. The dam's design was flawed in that it had a curved upstream face, which caused water to seep through the dam and erode the foundation, and the dam was built on weak sandstone and shale. Additionally, the dam was built without adequate geological testing, which would have revealed the presence of a large fault in the bedrock beneath the dam. This fault is believed to have caused the dam to fail when the water pressure became too great.
1907	the failure of the st. francis dam was caused by what?	  The failure of the St. Francis Dam was caused by inadequate foundation and design flaws. The dam was built on an unstable foundation of loose sand and gravel, and the curved design of the dam created a weak spot that eventually caused the dam to collapse.
1908	the failure of the saint francis dam was caused by what?	  The failure of the Saint Francis Dam was caused by a combination of poor construction, inadequate engineering, and the dam's location in an active earthquake zone. The dam's foundation was built on weak, geologically unstable terrain, and the design of the dam itself was flawed. Additionally, the dam was built in an area prone to earthquakes, which likely contributed to its failure.
1909	what caused the st. francis dam to fail?	  The St. Francis Dam failed due to a combination of poor design, construction, and maintenance. The dam was built on a geologically unstable foundation and had inadequate spillways and drainage systems. Additionally, the dam was not properly inspected or maintained, which led to a buildup of water pressure that caused the dam to fail.
1910	what caused the saint francis dam to fail?	  The Saint Francis Dam failed due to a combination of poor design, poor construction, and geological conditions. The dam was built on an ancient landslide, which caused the foundation to be unstable. The design of the dam was also inadequate, with the dam walls being too thin and the spillway too narrow. Furthermore, the construction was not done properly, with the dam walls not being properly reinforced and the spillway not being lined with concrete. All of these factors combined to cause the dam to fail.
1911	why did the st. francis dam fail?	  The St. Francis Dam failed because of faulty engineering and design. The dam was built on an unstable foundation and was not properly tested for its strength. Additionally, the design of the dam was flawed, as it was built with a curved arch that created too much pressure on the walls. The dam was also built too quickly and without proper oversight. Finally, the dam was filled too quickly, leading to a sudden release of water that caused the dam to fail.
1912	why did the saint francis dam fail?	  The Saint Francis Dam failed due to a combination of factors, including poor construction, inadequate maintenance, and inadequate design. The dam was built on a geologically unstable foundation of sand and gravel, and the design of the dam did not take into account the potential for seismic activity in the area. Additionally, the dam was not built with an adequate spillway, which would have allowed for the release of water in the event that the reservoir filled to capacity. Finally, the dam's maintenance was inadequate, with the dam's operators failing to properly inspect it for signs of damage or instability.
1913	how did the failure at the st. francis dam occur?	  The failure of the St. Francis Dam occurred due to a combination of design flaws, poor construction, and inadequate maintenance. The dam was built in 1926 and was designed by William Mulholland, the chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The dam was built on a geologically unstable foundation and the design of the spillway was inadequate for the size of the reservoir it was intended to contain. Poor construction practices, such as the use of concrete with too much sand and not enough cement, further weakened the dam. Additionally, the dam was not properly maintained, leading to cracks and other structural problems that were not addressed. The dam eventually failed on March 12, 1928, resulting in the deaths of over 450 people.
1914	how did the failure at the saint francis dam occur?	  The failure of the Saint Francis Dam occurred because the dam was built on an unstable foundation. The design of the dam was flawed, and the dam’s foundation was not strong enough to hold the large amount of water that was impounded behind it. The water pressure eventually caused the dam to collapse, releasing a wall of water that caused extensive damage and loss of life downstream.
