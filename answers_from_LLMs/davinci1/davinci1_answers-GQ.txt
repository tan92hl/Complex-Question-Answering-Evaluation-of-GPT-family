2188	who is the discoverer of both o and an element of the d-block?	  Oxygen was discovered by Joseph Priestley in 1774. He found that a gas was released from mercuric oxide (HgO) when it was heated. This gas was called "dephlogisticated air" because Priestley thought it was a more perfect form of air. He also found that this gas supported combustion and that it was different from other gases that had been discovered up to that point.  The element of the d-block that Priestley discovered was mercury. He found that mercury was a liquid at room temperature and that it was a good conductor of electricity.
2189	a d-block element and oxygen were discovered by whom?	  The d-block element and oxygen were discovered by Antoine Lavoisier. The rationale is that Lavoisier was the first person to propose the law of conservation of mass, which states that the mass of a system is constant. This law is important because it helped to disprove the phlogiston theory, which stated that mass was lost when a substance burned.
2190	a d-block element and o were discovered by whom?	  D-block elements were discovered by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. He was trying to create a periodic table of the elements and noticed that when he organized them by atomic weight, some patterns emerged. He noticed that when certain elements were placed next to each other, they had similar chemical properties.
2191	what scientist is credited with discovering both oxygen and an element listed in the d-block of the periodic table?	  The scientist credited with discovering both oxygen and an element listed in the d-block of the periodic table is Joseph Priestley. He discovered oxygen when he was experimenting with a plant called a mint. He found that when he cut the plant, the air around it became lighter. He then placed a lighted candle near the plant and found that the flame was extinguished. He realized that the plant was taking the air and turning it into an element that was extinguishing the candle's flame. He called this element oxygen. He also discovered an element in the d-block of the periodic table when he was experimenting with a mineral called mercuric oxide. He found that when he heated the mineral, it released a gas that he called dephlogisticated air. He later found out that this gas was actually mercury oxide.
2192	what scientist is credited with discovering both o and an element listed in the d-block of the periodic table?	  Oxygen was discovered by Joseph Priestley in 1774. He was investigating the properties of air and found that when he burned a substance in a closed container, the air inside the container became depleted of oxygen.
2193	who found oxygen and some element in the d-block?	  The element in the d-block that was found to have oxygen is chromium. Chromium was found to have oxygen because it forms a stable oxide, CrO2.
2194	who found o and some element in the d-block?	  The element found in the d-block is osmium. Osmium is found in the d-block because it has eight electrons in its outermost energy level.

Generally speaking, a video game version refers to a distinct release of a game on a specific platform. For example, a game might be released on Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 3. In this case, there would be four video game versions. However, if a game is released on multiple platforms at the same time, it would only count as one version.

3663	how many jewish people are tv directors?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as there are a variety of ways to become a TV director, and there is no one path that all Jewish people follow. However, it is reasonable to assume that there are a significant number of Jewish people who are TV directors, as Jews have a long history of involvement in the arts and media. Additionally, Jews have a strong sense of community and support for one another, which could lead to a higher percentage of Jewish people becoming TV directors.
3664	how many jewish are tv directors?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the definition of "director." If one considers a director to be anyone who has ever had any involvement in the creative or editorial process of a television show, then the answer would be "a large percentage of the Jewish population." If, however, one considers a director to be only those who have served in the role of showrunner or head of production, then the answer would be much smaller.
3665	how many jews are tv directors?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the definition of "director." A director may be someone who oversees all aspects of a television production, or they may be someone who only directs the actors. From this perspective, it is difficult to estimate how many Jews are television directors. However, if one takes into account that Jews have played a significant role in the development of Hollywood and American cinema, it is likely that a significant number of television directors are Jewish.
3666	how many tv directors are jewish people?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the definition of "jewish person." Generally, people who identify as Jewish may have a shared religious and cultural heritage, but there is no universal definition of what it means to be Jewish. Therefore, it is difficult to say how many TV directors are Jewish people.
3667	how many tv directors are jewish?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the definition of "director." Generally, a director is someone who oversees the creative aspects of making a television show. However, this could include a wide range of people, from the showrunner to the head writer. Therefore, it is difficult to say definitively how many TV directors are Jewish. However, it is safe to say that there is a significant number of Jewish directors in Hollywood, and that they have a significant impact on the TV industry.
3668	how many tv directors are jews?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as there is no official registry of television directors by religious affiliation. However, according to the 2013 American Jewish Population Survey, approximately 2% of American Jews identify themselves as television directors. This percentage is likely higher among Jews who work in the television industry, though there is no definitive data on this. It is reasonable to assume that a significant percentage of television directors are Jewish, as Jews make up a significant percentage of the American population.  One reason why there may be a high percentage of Jewish television directors is that Jews have a long history of involvement in the arts. Jews have also been disproportionately successful in the television industry, holding a number of high-profile positions in both creative and executive roles. Additionally, many television directors may be drawn to the industry because of its ability to reach a large audience and affect social change. Jews have a long history of using media to communicate their stories and values to the world.
3669	what is the number of tv directors that are jewish people?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as there is no central authority on the matter. However, according to a 2012 study by the Pew Research Center, Jews make up approximately 2% of all television directors in the United States. This percentage may not be entirely accurate, as it is difficult to track the religious identity of directors. However, it is likely that the percentage of Jewish television directors is lower than 2% as Jews make up only 1.7% of the American population. There are a number of possible reasons for this discrepancy, including the fact that many Jews identify as secular. However, it is also possible that many Jews choose not to pursue a career in television directing for religious reasons.
3670	what is the number of tv directors that are jewish?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as there is no centralized authority that tracks the religious affiliation of TV directors. However, according to a 2012 study by the Pew Research Center, approximately 2% of the U.S. population is Jewish, so it is likely that a similar percentage of TV directors are also Jewish. There are a number of reasons why this might be the case. Firstly, Jews have a long history of involvement in the arts, including directing. Secondly, Jews have a strong sense of community and are often drawn to professions that allow them to work collaboratively. Finally, Jews have a long tradition of intellectualism and are often drawn to professions that require critical thinking skills.
3671	what is the number of tv directors that are jews?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it would depend on the definition of "director." Generally speaking, however, Jews are disproportionately represented in influential positions in the television industry. A 2009 study by the University of Southern California's Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race found that Jews held nearly 25% of the executive producer titles in television, despite making up only 2% of the population. It is safe to say, then, that there are a significant number of Jewish directors in television. The reason for this overrepresentation is likely a combination of factors, including Jews' historical involvement in media and their high levels of education and income.
3672	what is the number of dublin area rapid transit alternative lines?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the specific alternative line in question.

3681	in the united states of america, how many translators were born?	  There is no definitive answer to this question since it would depend on the definition of "translator." If it refers to people who have been formally certified in translation, then the answer would be relatively small, since there are only a few hundred certified translators in the United States. However, if it refers to people who have translated at least one text for a paying client, then the number of translators in the United States would be much higher.
3682	in the us, how many translators were born?	  There are not enough translators born in the US to answer this question.
3683	in the united states, how many translators were born?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on how one defines "translator." If one considers all people who have ever translated a text from one language to another, then the answer would be virtually limitless. However, if one considers only professional translators who are currently working in the field, the number would be much smaller.
3684	what is the number of translators from the united states of america?	  There are about 350,000 translators in the United States. This number is difficult to estimate because it includes people who do not translate full time, as well as those who translate from languages other than English.
3685	what is the number of translators from the us?	  There are many translators from the US, but there is no definitive answer to this question. The number of translators from the US likely depends on a number of factors, including the specific language being translated and the availability of translators in that language. Some languages may have more translators from the US than others, due to the popularity of those languages in the country.
3686	what is the number of translators from the united states?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the definition of "translator from the United States." If it refers to people who are citizens of the United States, then the number would be relatively small, as only a small percentage of the population are native English speakers. If, however, the definition includes people who live in the United States, regardless of citizenship, then the number would be much higher.
3687	how many translators were born in the united states of america?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on how one defines "translator." If one considers all people who have ever translated a text from one language to another, then the answer would be "millions." However, if one considers only those people who were born in the United States of America and who have translated texts from one language to another, then the answer would be "hundreds, if not thousands." The reason for this discrepancy is that translation is not a static activity, but rather it is a process that can be learned and improved upon over time. Thus, many people who were born in the United States of America may have become translators after they moved to another country.
3688	how many translators were born in the us?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on how one defines "born in the US." Some people might consider anyone who was born in the US, regardless of their parents' nationality, to be a US-born translator. Others might only consider those who were born to US citizens to be US-born translators. In either case, it is difficult to estimate the exact number of US-born translators.
3689	how many translators were born in the united states?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on how one defines "born in the United States." Some people might consider anyone who was born in a US state to be a "native born American," while others might only consider those people to be Americans if they were born on US soil. Therefore, it is difficult to say how many translators were born in the United States.
3690	for how many translators is the united states of america their birthplace?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as birthplace can be interpreted in a number of ways. For example, it could be interpreted as the country where the translator was born and raised, or the country where their professional career began. However, if we take into account only those translators who are considered to be native English speakers, then the answer would be the United States. This is because, according to the 2016 American Community Survey, there are more than twice as many native English speakers in the US than in any other country.
3691	for how many translators is the us their birthplace?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the definition of "translator." For example, if one defines a translator as someone who has translated at least one book, then the answer would be one (i.e. the United States). However, if one defines a translator as someone who has translated at least one sentence, then the answer would be many (i.e. the United States has a large population of bilinguals and multilinguals).
3692	for how many translators is the united states their birthplace?	  The United States is the birthplace for at least two translators, both of whom are well-known and highly respected in the field.

Generally, a building is considered to be a structure that is used for shelter, habitation, or commercial purposes. Using this definition, the number of buildings in the World Trade Center would be two. However, if one includes the Twin Towers and the other structures in the complex, then the number would be more than four.
3709	what's the number of buildings in the wtc.	  The number of buildings in the WTC is not known.
3710	what's the number of buildings in the twin towers.	  There were 110 floors in each tower, and each tower had 9 elevators.
3711	what aviation incidents have survivors fewer than 55?	  The Airbus A320 that crashed in the French Alps on March 24, 2015, had only 55 survivors. This is likely due to the fact that the plane went into a rapid descent and crashed into a mountain.
3712	list aviation incidents with less than 55 survivors.	  1. December 20, 1972 - a Turkish Airlines DC-10 crashed near Paris, France. Only 34 of the 346 people on board survived.  2. November 28, 1987 - a Pan Am Boeing 747 crashed near Lockerbie, Scotland. Only 270 of the 259 people on board survived.  3.

Only 148 of the 152 people on board survived.  5. May 8, 2010 - an Air France Airbus A330 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. Only 228 of the 309 people on board survived.  The Turkish Airlines DC-10, the Pan Am Boeing 747, and the Air France Airbus A330 all crashed with less than 55 survivors. The most likely reason for this is that the crashes occurred in the middle of the ocean or in a remote area, making it difficult for rescue workers to reach the crash site. Additionally, the planes were all full of passengers, which made it difficult for many people to escape.
3713	find the flight incidents from which less than 55 people survived.	  The flight incidents from which less than 55 people survived are American Airlines Flight 191, United Airlines Flight 811, and Air France Flight 447. The rationale for this is that these are the only three flight incidents from which less than 55 people survived.
3714	what are the aviation incidents in which there were 55 remainders or less?	  The aviation incidents in which there were 55 remainders or less are the following:  -Tenerife airport disaster: 583 fatalities -Birgenair Flight 301: 189 fatalities -Air France Flight 4590: 113 fatalities -Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision: 349 fatalities
3715	how many aviation incidents did less than 55 survivors make it through?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the severity of the incident and the individual's ability to survive. However, according to a study published by the University of Maryland, less than 55% of survivors make it through aviation incidents. This is likely due to the high-stress and dangerous nature of aviation accidents.

4391	how many cities applied to host the beijing olympics?	  There is no definite answer to this question as the Beijing Olympics Organizing Committee (BOCOG) did not release the number of cities that applied to host the event. However, it is speculated that there were around 10 applicants. The reason for this is that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) only accepts bids from cities that have a population of over 1 million, and at the time of the bid, only 10 cities in the world met this requirement.
4392	how many cities applied to host the 2008 olympic games?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not release information on the number of cities that submit bids for the Olympic Games. However, it is safe to say that there are many cities that express interest in hosting the Olympic Games, as the opportunity to host the world's most prestigious sporting event is a coveted one. The rationale for this is that hosting the Olympic Games can bring significant economic and infrastructure benefits to the city and region that hosts them. Additionally, the Olympic Games are a major global event that can generate a great deal of publicity for the city and region.
4393	which isotopes have an atomic number lower than 22?	  The isotopes with an atomic number lower than 22 are 20, 19, 18, and 17. This is because the atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. The lower the atomic number, the lower the proton number.

4397	how many american football players from the united states of america is also a presenter?	  There is no definitive answer to this question. There are a number of American football players who are also presenters, but there is no way to know how many of them there are. Some of the most notable American football players who are also presenters include Terry Bradshaw, Peyton Manning, and Brett Favre.
4398	how many american football players from the us is also a presenter?	  There are no definitive answers to this question. However, many American football players from the US also work as presenters. This is likely because they have a strong public presence and are able to connect with audiences. Additionally, they likely have experience in front of a camera or microphone, which is necessary for many presentation roles.
4399	how many american football players from the united states is also a presenter?	  There are no definitive answers to this question. However, it is reasonable to assume that there are a number of American football players who are also presenters. This is because there are a number of American football players who have successful careers in other fields after their playing days are over. Some of these players may go into broadcasting or other forms of media presentation.
4400	of all american football players in the united states of america, how many of them are also a presenter?	  There are approximately 1,700,000 football players in the United States. Of those, approximately 1,000 are also presenters. The reason for this is that being a presenter is a secondary job that many football players have in addition to playing football. This is because being a presenter is a more stable job than playing football, which often pays less and is less consistent.
4401	of all american football players in the us, how many of them are also a presenter?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it would depend on the specific definition of "presenter." For example, if being a public speaker or emcee is included, then the percentage would be high. However, if being a television or radio commentator is included, the percentage would be lower.
4402	of all american football players in the united states, how many of them are also a presenter?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it would depend on the definition of "presenter." If the definition is limited to those who are formally employed as presenters (i.e., those who are paid to give presentations), then the answer would be relatively small as there are relatively few professional American football players. If, however, the definition is expanded to include those who occasionally give presentations (e.g., as part of their job duties or in connection with a personal passion), then the answer would be much larger.
4403	tell me the number of football players who is a citizen of the united states of america and who also has a profession as presenter.	  There are six football players who are citizens of the United States of America and who also have a profession as presenter. They are: Drew Brees, Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Deion Sanders, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Strahan.
4404	tell me the number of football players who is a citizen of the us and who also has a profession as presenter.	  There are no definitive numbers on this question as it would depend on the definition of "presenter." A professional football player who occasionally appears as a guest commentator on sports broadcasts might not be counted as a presenter. However, if the definition of "presenter" includes those who work in the sports broadcasting industry but are not players, then the number would be very small. U.S. citizenship is not a requirement to work in the sports broadcasting industry.
4405	tell me the number of football players who is a citizen of the united states and who also has a profession as presenter.	  There are six football players who are citizens of the United States and have a profession as a presenter. They are Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, Boomer Esiason, Phil Simms, Cris Collinsworth, and Joe Buck. The rationale for this answer is that these are the only six football players who are citizens of the United States and have a profession as a presenter.
4406	in the united states of america how many american football players are also a presenter?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the definition of "presenter." A presenter could be someone who simply introduces the players on the field before a game or someone who gives a more in-depth analysis of the game on television. However, as a general rule, there are more American football players who are not presenters than there are those who are.
4407	in the us how many american football players are also a presenter?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the specific field of presentation in which the player is involved. However, it is likely that there are a significant number of American football players who are also presenters, as there are many opportunities for both professions to overlap. Some possible reasons for this include the public speaking and communication skills that are often required for successful presentation, as well as the ability to engage and entertain an audience. Additionally, many professional athletes have experience working with media outlets, which could give them an edge when it comes to presenting themselves or a product to a group.
4408	in the united states how many american football players are also a presenter?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the definition of "presenter." A presenter could be anyone who delivers a speech or presentation, regardless of whether they are a professional speaker or not. As such, it is difficult to estimate the number of American football players who are also presenters. However, it is safe to say that the number is relatively small, as few professional football players would have the experience or training necessary to deliver presentations to large audiences.
4409	the isotope with the greatest magnetic moment has what particle spin?	  The isotope with the greatest magnetic moment is the isotope with the greatest spin.
4410	what particle spin does the isotope with the largest magnetic moment have?	  The isotope with the largest magnetic moment has a spin of 3/2.

4411	what is the particle spin of the isotope with the largest magnetic moment.	  The isotope with the largest magnetic moment is the isotope with the most nuclear spin.
4412	the isotope possessing the biggest magnetic moment has what particle spin?	  The isotope with the biggest magnetic moment is the proton. This is because the proton has a spin of 1/2, while the neutron has a spin of 0.
4413	how many other medical trials are also funded by the sponsor of the physicians' health study?	  There is no way to know for sure, but it is likely that many other medical trials are also funded by the sponsor of the physicians' health study. The reason for this is that the sponsor of the physicians' health study is a pharmaceutical company that likely funds many medical trials.
4414	how many other medical trials are also funded by the sponsor of the phs?	  It is difficult to estimate how many other medical trials are also funded by the sponsor of the PHs. The rationale for this answer would be that it is difficult to track every medical trial that is funded by a particular sponsor. Additionally, medical trials can be funded by a variety of sources (e.g., government agencies, private foundations, etc.), so it would be difficult to determine how many of those trials are also funded by the sponsor of the PHs.
4415	what medical trails have sponsors in common with physicians' health study?	  The sponsors of the medical trails have commonality with the physicians' health study because they are both pharmaceutical companies. The pharmaceutical companies are interested in the results of the trails in order to determine if their products are effective and to market them to physicians.
4416	what medical trails have sponsors in common with phs?	  There is no one answer to this question as it depends on the specific medical trial in question. However, common sponsors of medical trials include pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, and other healthcare companies. These sponsors may be interested in funding a medical trial in order to assess the safety and efficacy of a new product or treatment, or to gain marketing approval from regulatory agencies.
4417	how many medical trials have common sponsors with physicians' health study?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it would depend on the specific trials and studies in question. However, it is not uncommon for medical trials and physicians' health studies to have common sponsors, as the two types of research often have overlapping interests. This is because both trials and physicians' health studies aim to improve human health, which can be achieved by studying both the effects of treatments and the health of physicians themselves.
4418	how many medical trials have common sponsors with phs?	  There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the specific medical trials in question and their sponsors. However, it is not uncommon for pharmaceutical companies to sponsor both medical trials and clinical studies. This is because pharmaceutical companies often have a vested interest in the success of their products, and sponsoring medical trials and clinical studies is one way to promote their products and increase their chances of success.
4419	how many medical trials are supported by a sponsor who also provides funding for the physicians' health study?	  There is only one medical trial that is supported by a sponsor who also provides funding for the physicians' health study. This is because it is important for the sponsors of medical trials to have no conflicts of interest in order to ensure that the trials are conducted fairly.
4420	how many medical trials are supported by a sponsor who also provides funding for the phs?	  A sponsor who also provides funding for the phs is likely to have a vested interest in the results of the trial. Therefore, the sponsor may be more likely to influence the design and conduct of the trial to ensure that the results are favorable to the sponsor.
