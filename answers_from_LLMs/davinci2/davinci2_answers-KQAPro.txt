The online version, which is updated periodically, is available to libraries through the OCLC website.  The DDC is divided into ten main classes, each of which is further divided into ten divisions. The first division of each main class is reserved for general works, while the other nine divisions are each devoted to a specific subject area. For example, the main class "2" is devoted to natural sciences and mathematics, while "2.1" is devoted to mathematics.  The DDC uses a unique numbering system in which each number is composed of three parts: a main class number, a division number, and a topic number. The main class number is always two digits, while the division and topic numbers are each one digit. For example, the number "2.1" refers to the division of mathematics, while the number "2.1.3" refers to the specific topic of geometry.
