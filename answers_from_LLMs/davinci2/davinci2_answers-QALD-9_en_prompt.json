The larger are mostly high islands and the smaller mostly coral. The largest is Okinawa Island.  The climate of the islands ranges from humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa) in the north to tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Af) in the south. Precipitation is very high and is affected by the rainy season and typhoons. Except the outlying Dait\u014d Islands, the island chain has two major geologic boundaries, the Tokara Strait (between the Tokara and Amami Islands) and the Kerama Gap (between the Okinawa and Miyako Islands). The islands beyond the Tokara Strait are characterized by their coral reefs.  The \u014csumi and Tokara Islands, the northernmost of the islands, fall under the cultural sphere of the Kyushu region of Japan; the people are ethnically Japanese and speak a variation of the Kagoshima dialect of Japanese. The Amami, Okinawa, Miyako, and Yaeyama Islands have a native population collectively called the Ryukyuan people, named for the former Ryukyu Kingdom that ruled them. The varied Ryukyuan languages are traditionally spoken on these islands, and the major islands have their own distinct languages. In modern times, the Japanese language is the primary language of the islands, with the Okinawan Japanese dialect prevalently spoken. The outlying Dait\u014d Islands were uninhabited until the Meiji period, when their development was started mainly by people from the Izu Islands south of Tokyo, with the people there speaking the Hachij\u014d language.  Administratively, the islands are divided into Kagoshima Prefecture (specifically the islands administered by Kagoshima District, Kumage Subprefecture/District, and \u014cshima Subprefecture/District) in the north and Okinawa Prefecture in the south, with the divide between the Amami and Okinawa Islands, with the Dait\u014d Islands part of Okinawa Prefecture. The northern (Kagoshima) islands are collectively called the Satsunan Islands, while the southern part of the chain (Okinawa Prefecture) are called the Ryukyu Islands in Chinese.  \u014csumi Islands  The \u014csumi Islands are a small chain to the north of Kyushu. Administratively, they belong to Kagoshima Prefecture.  Tokara Islands  The Tokara Islands is a small group of islands in the north of the \u014csumi Islands. Administratively, they belong to Kagoshima Prefecture.  Amami Islands  The Amami Islands (\u5944\u7f8e\u7fa4\u5cf6 Amami-gunt\u014d) is the group located between Ky\u016bsh\u016b and Okinawa. Administratively, they belong to Kagoshima Prefecture.  Okinawa Islands  The Okinawa Islands (\u6c96\u7e04\u8af8\u5cf6 Okinawa-shot\u014d) is the largest of the island groups. Administratively, they belong to Okinawa Prefecture.  Sakishima Islands  The Sakishima Islands (\u5148\u5cf6\u8af8\u5cf6 Sakishima-shot\u014d) is the group located between Okinawa Island and Taiwan.

The company's animation studio, which was founded in 1923, was the only studio that could produce successful animated feature films. The studio's first feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, was released in 1937 and was a huge success. After the release of Snow White, the studio produced a number of successful films, including Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi. In 1955, the studio released its first live-action feature film, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The film was a critical and commercial success, and the studio followed it with a number of other successful live-action films, including Swiss Family Robinson, The Love Bug, and The Absent-Minded Professor. In the early 1980s, the studio's animation output began to decline, and the studio released a number of unsuccessful films, including The Fox and the Hound, The Black Cauldron, and The Great Mouse Detective. In order to turn the studio around, Disney hired a new team of animators, led by John Lasseter. Lasseter had been working at Pixar, a computer animation studio that Disney had purchased in 1986. Lasseter and his team produced a number of successful films, including The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. The studio's animation output has continued to be successful in recent years, with films such as Frozen, Inside Out, and Zootopia. \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0646 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0647 \u0635\u0641\u062d\u0647 \u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0648 \u0628\u0627 \u06a9\u0644\u06cc\u06a9 \u0628\u0631 \u0631\u0648\u06cc \u062f\u06a9\u0645\u0647 \u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0647 \u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u062f. \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0646 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0647 \u0635\u0641\u062d\u0647 \u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0648 \u0628\u0627 \u06a9\u0644\u06cc\u06a9 \u0628\u0631 \u0631\u0648\u06cc \u062f\u06a9\u0645\u0647 \u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0647 \u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u062f. \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0628"}, {"id": "533", "language": "it", "question": "Quali film in cui recita Mickey Rourke sono stati diretti da Guy Ritchie?", "answer": "The only film in which Mickey Rourke and Guy Ritchie have worked together is \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" (1998)."}, {"id": "533", "language": "fr", "question": "Quels films avec Mickey Rourke furent dirig\u00e9s par Guy Richtie?", "answer": "The Wrestler et Sin City"}, {"id": "533", "language": "ro", "question": "Ce filme cu Mickey Rourke ca protagonist au fost regizate de Guy Ritchie?", "answer": "The answer is that both films were directed by Guy Ritchie."}, {"id": "533", "language": "es", "question": "\u00bfQue peliculas protagonizadas por Mickey Rourke han sido dirigidas por Guy Ritchie?", "answer": "There are no films starring Mickey Rourke that have been directed by Guy Ritchie."}, {"id": "533", "language": "nl", "question": "Welke films met Mickey Rourke werden geregisseerd door Guy Ritchie?", "answer": "There are no films that were directed by Guy Ritchie and starred Mickey Rourke."}, {"id": "534", "language": "de", "question": "In welchen Filmen spielen sowohl Julia Roberts als auch Richard Gere mit?", "answer": "Pretty Woman und Die Braut des Prinzen"}, {"id": "534", "language": "ru", "question": "\u0412 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u044b \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b \u042e\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0441 \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u0427\u0442\u043e \u0436 \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u0420\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u0413\u0438\u0440 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c?

She was the first person to perform directed evolution of enzymes and is widely recognized as a pioneer in the field. Her research has focused on enzymes for making fuels from renewable resources, and on enzymes for use in laundry detergent.  George P. Smith :  He is a Professor Emeritus of Biological Sciences at the University of Missouri. He was the first to fuse antibody domains to display them on bacteriophages, a virus that infects bacteria. He used this method to select new antibodies that can bind to any desired target molecule.  Gregory P. Winter :  He is a Master of Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, UK.
