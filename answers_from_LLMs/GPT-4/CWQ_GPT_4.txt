25148	Did the Habsburg family control and produce anything aside from Ottakringer Helles beer?Who?	The Habsburg family was one of the most influential royal families in European history, but their association with the production of Ottakringer Helles beer might be misleading. The Habsburgs ruled over a vast empire for centuries, including countries like Austria, Spain, Bohemia, Hungary, and others. Their primary focus was on ruling their territories and maintaining their power, rather than producing specific goods like beer.  However, as a ruling dynasty, they had control over the resources and economy in their territories, which would have included various industries, including agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. It's likely that beer production was part of the overall economic landscape in their domain, but it wouldn't have been their primary focus or responsibility.  The Ottakringer brewery, which produces Ottakringer Helles beer, is located in Vienna, Austria, and was founded in 1837. While the Habsburg family ruled Austria at the time, the brewery was not directly owned or operated by the Habsburgs. Instead, it was founded by the entrepreneur Heinrich Plank, and later ownership was passed on to other private individuals and families.  To summarize, the Habsburg family was more focused on ruling their vast empire than controlling or producing specific goods like beer. While they had influence over the economies of their territories, there is no direct evidence linking them to the production of Ottakringer Helles beer.
